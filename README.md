### What is SFe?

Like many members of the soundfont community, we are tired of the limitations of the ancient SoundFont format. So, in 2020, we launched the SFe (SF-enhanced) project, to research backwards-compatible improvements and updates to the format.

To do this, we looked at many features that soundfont creators have requested, and are working on incorporating them into the SFe format.

### What are the goals of SFe?

The goals of the SFe project are to:

- Unite proprietary extensions to the SoundFont format
- Add the most requested features by soundfont developers
- Enable sample libraries that we could never have imagined 
- Create a viable competitor to commercial sample library formats (Kontakt, etc.)
- Allow intercompatibility between other open source sample library formats (such as SFZ)

### When will the specification become available?

We plan on releasing the first version of the SFe specification, version 4.0, on 8 February 2025. However, this is subject to change.

### Why does the specification not include everything?

To make it more concise, we only highlight the differences between the SFe specification and the legacy SoundFont specification (`SFSPEC24.PDF`). If you want to develop for SFe, we recommend that you also read the legacy SF2.04 specification (`SFSPEC24.PDF`).
