## 0.1a Specification Versioning

Final specifications have version numbers in the format x.yyL, where x and y are numbers and l is a letter:

- x is incremented when a change in the SFe64 format is made in a way that makes the resulting files incompatible with the previous version.
- y is incremented when there are new features added to either the SFe64 or the SFe32 format.
- SFe64 should not skip "y" versions. There will not be SFe32-only feature additions.
- L is incremented when there are small changes made to the specification, if L is absent, then assume that it is "a."
- An example of a final specification version would be 4.00.

Draft specification milestones have version numbers in the format x.yy.zL, where x, y and z are numbers and L is a letter. In this case, the versioning works similarly to a final specification, but with these changes:

- z is incremented when the draft undergoes a larger change, or large updates are made to the software.
- L is incremented when there are small changes, but only when pointed out by others.
- An example of a draft specification version would be 4.00.5.

During the development of specifications, version numbers will be in the format x.yy.aaaabbccL, where x, y, z, a, b and c are numbers, and L is a letter. The versioning is similar to final specifications and milestone drafts, but aaaabbcc is the day in which the specification was updated, and L is incremented when updated.

The revision history table refers to development versions as "This version" and includes the cumulative changes made to the specification since the last milestone revision.

## 0.2 Disclaimers

We don't own the rights to use the term "Soundfont," so the term SF is used instead.

The trademark rights to the term "Soundfont" belong to Creative Technology Ltd.

That being said, "soundfont" is rapidly becoming a genericised word via the actions of the VGM (video game music) and lightsaber communities (despite the lightsaber community not using .sf2 files, and misusing the term for another format).

We urge rights holders (Creative Technology Ltd.) to prevent the lightsaber community from appropriating the trademark for their unrelated format.

All excerpts from the SF 2.04 specification are copyrighted by E-mu Systems or Creative Technology Ltd, and are only used for reference. Everything should fall under fair use rights.

We are confident that the base file format is not copyrightable, but we are able to take this document down if necessary.

This is a draft. Expect errors, and feel free to report them. Sylvia-leaf has access to a computer with a Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium, so she will be able to test or reproduce any issues found on real hardware.

Do not use "draft" specifications (version number x.yy.zL) to base final products on. Always refer to a "final" specification (version number x.yyL).

## 0.3 Updates and comments

The website "soundfont.com" is dead (last archive.org snapshot we could found was 2012/13), and the provided email on the SF 2.04 spec probably doesn't work, so contact the SFe Team:

A link to the SF Server Discord will be provided soon.

# Section 1: Introduction

## 1.1a Scope and purpose of this document

- This is a draft specification for the SFe64 file format, version 4.00, based on the famous E-mu SystemsÂ® SoundFontÂ® 2.04, and Werner SF3 standards.
- It's intended to be a source of information on SFe64.
- To create files that support SFe64, you will need:
    - The SFe64 format, compatibility, and program specifications
    - The SFe32 format, compatibility, and program specifications
    - E-mu's provided documents for SF 2.04 ([sfspec24.pdf](https://freepats.zenvoid.org/sf2/sfspec24.pdf))
    - The Werner SF3 specification ([draft by FluidSynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/SoundFont3Format))
- All features from version 2.04 will be retained.

* * *

## 1.1b Important differences from the 2.04 document

- This is not a standalone document; it refers to both the SF 2.04 and Werner SF3 technical specifications.
- This document is unofficial and was not created by E-mu. If you want this to be removed, we will remove it, but we hope that this is because you have your own update to the SF format ready.
- For copyright reasons, we cannot copy information from the original standard, except for what is required to interpret this document and what is allowed under fair use.

* * *

## 1.2 Document organisation

The sections in this specification map to the E-mu SystemsÂ® SoundFontÂ® 2.04 specification document.

- Like the version 2.04 specification, section 1 and 2 gives introductory information about SFe64.
- Sections 3â€“8 provide detailed information about the updates made to the SFe64 structure.
- Section 9 shows the synthesis engine.
- Section 10 describes any error handling that is necessary when opening SFe64 files.
- Section 11 describes legacy ROM methods of storing an SFe64 file.
- Section 12 is a glossary of most terms in this draft specification.

New sections may be added in the future, depending on if radical changes are made to the format.

* * *

## 1.3 SFe objectives

### The SFe64 standard has been created to provide a 64-bit successor to E-mu SystemsÂ®'s SoundFontÂ® 2.04 standard, enabling file sizes of greater than 4 GiB, in addition to further building on the features of SFe32.

- The file size limit is 16 EiB.
- Large files (above 4 GiB) must use SFe64.
- Programs that are designed to create existing SF2 files can easily be adapted to 64-bit with the SFe64 format.
- SFe64 will allow creators of sound banks to replace split banks with a large number of SF2 files (and supporting files like SFLISTs), with huge, single, ready-to-use files, where all samples and instruments can be shared in the sound bank's presets.
- SFe64 compatible players require a certain standard of features, which is in the separate SFe program specification.

* * *

## 1.4 The background of the SF format

SoundFontÂ® 1 refers to the proprietary version of the format used by the Creative Sound BlasterÂ® AWE32 sound card released in 1994.

- SoundFontÂ® 1 files had a file extension of .SBK and cannot be used by many of SF 2.0x programs.
- This is the version used in the Creative DOS drivers.
- Creative is the brand name used by the company "Creative Technology Ltd."
- As the specification for SF 1 was never released, we don't know how SF 1 files were structured.

Creative decided to release the specification to the public with version 2.00 in 1996 (specification date October 1995).

- This requires the Windows drivers for use in older Sound BlasterÂ® cards.
- DOS drivers can only use .SBK (SoundFontÂ® 1) files.

In 1998, modulators were added in theÂ SoundFontÂ® 2 version 2.01 (specification date August 1997).

- It is backwards compatible with 2.00.
- This was designed for use in the new SB Live! card (EMU10K1).

Finally, in 2005, version 2.04 was released with 24-bit support (specification date September 2002).

- It is backwards compatible with 2.01.
- This was designed for the SB X-Fi.

E-mu then abandoned the format. Creative Technology Ltd is still around, however, as a public company.

Current Creative Labs sound cards do not support the SoundFontÂ® format; the Audigy RX from 2013 was the last model that supported the format. Newer cards, for instance, the AE-9, no longer use wavetable sound synthesis.

At an unknown time, Kenneth Rundt, the author of SynthFont and a series of products based on it, added some custom features, mostly ported over from the DLS format:

- Always play the sample to the end
- Velocity to volume envelope attack (from DLS)
- Velocity to modulation envelope attack (from DLS)
- Vibrato lfo to volume (from DLS)

Werner Schweer found a way to compress SoundFontÂ® 2 files (with the lossy Vorbis format) around 2010.

- The resulting format was known as SF3.
- It is commonly used by open source programs.
- This is the reason why this format is not called .SF3 (it was in 4.00.1, but after **feedback by derselbst** and **mawe42** on GitHub, we changed it to SFe32 and SFe64).
- SFe files will be compatible with Werner SF3 for compression.

Another development was done by Cognitone, which created an open source program that can losslessly compress SoundFontÂ® 2 files (with FLAC). This was done in 2017.

- This was unofficially called SF4.
- This is intended to be the true version 4, as Cognitone SF4Â seems to not have been as widespread as SF3.
- SF4 has also been rejected by the Werner SF3 community as too loosely defined.

Finally, stgiga found out that many programs don't mind RIFF64 (RF64) files. This is the purpose of the SFe64 format.

- RIFF64 files have a much larger size limit than 32-bit RIFF files.
- It gives us a new horizon to experiment with longer, higher quality samples.
- There are also many other advantages of the RIFF64 format.

This is where we stand right now.

* * *

## 1.5 Improvements and enhancements

SFe (version 4) is designed for future improvements.

- These will be done in a more liberal way than the conservative manner of the SoundFontÂ® 2 updates that E-mu has done.
- Some improvements will only be available in SFe64.
- SFe64 is not affected by limitations created by the EMU8000 sound processor and Sound BlasterÂ® cards, and therefore will have more improvements.
- To avoid over-stress of developers of the SFe Team, as well as SFe instrument banks, features will be spread out across versions. We hope to release a new version every 3â€“5 years.
- SFe64 development can be done in tandem with SFe32.

* * *

## 1.5a Plans

The features for version 4.00 have been frozen after the release of version 4.00.4. This doesn't mean that we're done with SFe, in fact, this is only the beginning of the format's development.

We decided to do a feature freeze for version 4.00 to make sure that SFe program developers have a reasonable set of features to implement. If we add too many features, it can overwhelm developers.

Here are a few things that are planned for SFe:

- An SDK to assist SFe program developers with creating programs for the new format will be available with the version 4.00 final specification.
    - The first part of this SDK including an implementation of SFe will release in 4.00.9. 
- For version 4.01, there will be an overhaul of the default modulators system, inspired by the [DMOD proposal by spessasus](https://github.com/davy7125/polyphone/issues/205).
- A MIDI lyrics specification for MIDI players will become available in version 4.02.
- We will negotiate with the Synthfont author Kenneth Rundt about getting the Synthfont Custom Features added for version 4.03.

# Section 2: Terms and abbreviations

## 2.1 Data structure terminology

The data structure terminology used in version 4 is broadly the same as the E-muÂ® SF2.04 standard, with these additions:

- BW64â€”Broadcast Wave 64, used in the RF64 Header.
- RF64 - See "RIFF64".
- RIFF64 - A format mostly compatible with RIFF, SF2.04's basic file format. This is 64-bit, unlike RIFF, which is 32-bit. Therefore, the maximum file size is above 4 gigabytes in size.

* * *

## 2.2 Synthesis terminology

The synth terminology used in SFe64 version 4.00 is broadly the same as the E-muÂ® SF2.04 standard, with these additions:

- AWE64 - The successor to the famous AWE32, added things like waveguide synthesis. Used the EMU8000 synthesizer chip, like the preceding AWE32. Available in "Value" or "Gold" versions.

- DAHDSR - Stands for Delay, attack, hold, decay, sustain, release. The six-step envelope system used in SF and SFe.

- EMU10K1â€”The successor to the EMU8000, designed by E-muÂ® for the Creative Labs SB Live!.

- EMU10K2 - An update to the EMU10K1, designed by E-muÂ® for the Creative Labs SB Audigy.

- EMU20K1 - The successor to the EMU10K2, designed by E-muÂ® for the Creative Labs SB X-Fi.

- EMU20K2â€”An update to the EMU20K1, please refer [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_X-Fi) for information on SB X-Fi cards that include it.

- Hold - The portion of the DAHDSR envelope after the attack portion, but before the decay portion starts.

- ROM samples - Obsolete feature used in legacy sound cards, most modern SF2 files do not use this feature.

- Sound BlasterÂ® Live! â€” The successor to the AWE64, which improved the synthesizer chip to the EMU10K1, supporting modulators.

- Sound BlasterÂ® Audigy - The successor to the SB Live!, containing the EMU10K2 chip.

- Sound BlasterÂ® X-Fi - The successor to the SB Audigy, containing the EMU20K1 or EMU20K2 chip. Supports 24-Bit SoundFontÂ® 2 files (2.04).

- Synth - Abbreviation of "Synthesiser," see "Synthesiser" in the 2.04 specification for more information.

- Version 3 - Refers to Werner SF3, a small upgrade to SoundfontÂ® 2.04 created by Werner Schweer to allow an open source compression solution for SF programs (usually ogg, but can be any format).

- Version 4 - This new specification, based on SoundFontÂ® 2.04 and Werner SF3, with a set of new features making it more realistic. Not to be confused with the unofficial Cognitone .sf4 file format, which is an incompatible variant of Werner SF3.


These changes:

- Articulation - Modulation of available parameters and usage of extra samples to produce expressive musical notes.
- Downloadable - SF version 2, 3 or SFe file obtained from the internet. (Old meaning referred to the obsolete ROM system)
- MIDI Bank - Groups of up to 128 presets, which can be selected by the two MIDI "Bank Select" control changes (CC00 and CC32).

And these removals:

- Preditor (refers to an old SF version 2 editor made by E-mu)

The terminology is also the same as SFe32 version 4.00.

* * *

## 2.3 Parameter terminology

The parameter terminology used in version 4 is broadly the same as the E-muÂ® SF2.04 standard, with these additions:

- Amplification - An increase in volume or amplitude of a signal.
- Flat - Said of a tone that is lower in pitch than another reference tone.

The terminology is also the same as SFe32 version 4.00.

# Section 3: RIFF and RF64 structure

## 3.1 General RIFF and RF64 file structures

### The RIFF format is the file format used in the SoundFontÂ® 2.x and Werner SF3 standards, and in SFe32.

### The RIFF64 format (also called RF64) is the file format used in SFe64. It is compatible with RIFF.

Both RIFF and RIFF64 are created in building blocks known as "chunks."

Chunks are defined using this structure:

- A unique four character code (FourCC).
- "ckID": type of data in chunk
- "ckSize": size of chunk (SFe32), equal to 4,294,967,295 (SFe64)
- "ds64": size of chunk (SFe64)
- "ckDATA\[ckSize\]": the data inside the chunks, including pad bytes.

Chunks can be further divided into "sub-chunks."

Orders of chunks in all SF files are strictly defined, as in versions 2 and 3, and should be kept to.

* * *

## 3.2 Chunks and subchunks in version 4

Like SoundFontÂ® 2.04, there are 3 main chunks:

1.  "INFO" Chunk: contains important information about the soundfont.

2.  "sdta" Chunk: A single sub-chunk containing audio samples.

3.  "pdta" Chunk: Nine sub-chunks (in the "Hydra" structure, named after a many-headed beast) containing the parameters about how the audio samples should be played. (According to E-mu, the hydra has nine heads. Cut one off, and another two grow.)


The three main chunks should appear in this order, and the nine sub-chunks of the "pdta" chunk should appear in the order described.

* * *

## 3.3 Error handling

The RIFF and RF64 formats have error checking features about:

- The size of the file
- The length of the chunks
- The length of the sub-chunks

Using this information, it is possible to check for damage to an SF(e) file:

- If any damage is detected due to such a mismatch, the file should be rejected as "Structurally Unsound."
- Like E-muÂ® SoundFontÂ® 2.x and Werner SF3, developers can create programs which correct "Structurally Unsound" files of version 4 and later.
- Please refer to the File Repair Specification for help on how to create such a program.

## 4.5 Type definitions

The type definitions are identical to those used in SoundFontÂ® version 2.04.

* * *

## 4.5a File format extensions

SFe64 files may use the extension .SFE64 to prevent playback in legacy SF players that do not support SFe64.

# Section 5: "info-list" chunk

## 5.1 "ifil" subchunk

WORD wMajor = 4

- The version is 4.00, so the wMajor is changed from 2 (in v2.04) to 4.

WORD wMinor = 0

- The minor version has been reset to 0 because the wMajor has changed to 3.

The size must be exactly four bytes. Reject files with an "ifil" subchunk that isn't four bytes as "Structurally Unsound."

If the "ifil" subchunk is missing, either:

- Assume version 4.0.
- Reject the file as "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 5.1a Versioning rules

In SFe64 version 4, new versioning rules are used to replace the old ones.

The value of wMajor increases every time a change is made to the format that makes it incompatible with existing players.

- There will be at least 6 months between the first draft milestone of a new wMajor version and the release of the final specification.
- Older wMajor versions must be supported, either directly or via translation to the latest version.
- We strive to minimize the number of these updates whenever possible in favor of updates that are backward compatible.

The value of wMinor increases every time a change is made to the format while retaining backwards compatibility.

- These updates generally have only one or two draft milestones before the final specification releases.
- Feature updates in these versions are smaller.

To signify that the SFe file has been created to a draft specification, please use the description.

* * *

## 5.2 "isng" subchunk

A new default isng sub-chunk value is used in SFe: "SFe32 version 4" (SFe32) or "SFe64 version 4" (SFe64)

- SFe version 4 players should recognize this and remove the default velocity related filter used in SoundFontÂ® 2.04.
- The ten "Default Modulators" will also be disabled by default. The Default modulation definition will be added in SFe version 4.01.
- In the case of a missing isng chunk, files with an ifil sub-chunk with wMajor = 2 or 3 and wMinor >= 128, assume an isng sub-chunk value of "SFe32 version 4." Don't assume "EMU8000." This is for backwards compatibility with SFe32.
- In the case of a missing isng chunk, files with an ifil sub-chunk with wMajor >= 4, assume an isng sub-chunk value of "SFe64 version 4." Don't assume "EMU8000."

Reject anything not terminated with a zero byte, and assume the value "SFe64 version 4." Do NOT assume "EMU8000" by default.

* * *

## 5.3 "INAM" subchunk

This is mostly the same as in SoundFontÂ® 2.04, but UTF-8 is now used instead of ASCII.

- The "INAM" subchunk contains a UTF-8 string of up to 256 bytes.
- Example of value: "GM Sound Set" (with appropriate zero bytes)

Reject anything not terminated with a zero byte. Do NOT reject the file as "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 5.4 "irom" subchunk

- Read the SoundFontÂ® 2.04 specification for info on how to use ROM samples.
- The ROM emulator should be implemented in SFe64 programs.
- This subchunk will eventually be reused for other features in a future version of this specification.

* * *

## 5.5 "iver" subchunk

- Read the SoundFontÂ® 2.04 specification for info on how to use ROM samples.
- The ROM emulator should be implemented in SFe64 programs.
- This subchunk will eventually be reused for other features in a future version of this specification.

* * *

## 5.6 "ICRD" subchunk

This is mostly the same as in SoundFontÂ® 2.04, but UTF-8 is now used instead of ASCII.

- The "ICRD" subchunk contains a UTF-8 string of up to 256 bytes.
- Example of value: "October 17, 2024" (with appropriate zero bytes)

Reject anything not terminated with a zero byte.Â Do NOT reject the file as "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 5.7 "IENG" subchunk

This is mostly the same as in SoundFontÂ® 2.04, but UTF-8 is now used instead of ASCII.

- The "IENG" subchunk contains a UTF-8 string of up to 256 bytes.
- Example of value: "SF Author" (with appropriate zero bytes)

Reject anything not terminated with a zero byte.Â Do NOT reject the file as "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 5.8 "IPRD" subchunk

This is mostly the same as in SoundFontÂ® 2.04, but UTF-8 is now used instead of ASCII.

- The "IPRD" subchunk contains a UTF-8 string of up to 256 bytes.
- Example of value: "SFe64 Players" (with appropriate zero bytes)

Reject anything not terminated with a zero byte.Â Do NOT reject the file as "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 5.9 "ICOP" subchunk

This is mostly the same as in SoundFontÂ® 2.04, but UTF-8 is now used instead of ASCII.

- The "ICOP" subchunk contains a UTF-8 string of up to 256 bytes.
- Example of value: "Copyright Â© All Rights Reserved." (with appropriate zero bytes)

Reject anything not terminated with a zero byte.Â Do NOT reject the file as "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 5.10 "ICMT" subchunk

This is mostly the same as in SoundFontÂ® 2.04, but UTF-8 is now used instead of ASCII.

- The "ICMT" subchunk contains a UTF-8 string of up to 65,536 bytes.
- Example of value: "This file contains 128 instruments and a drum kit." (with appropriate zero bytes)

Reject anything not terminated with a zero byte. Do NOT reject the file as "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 5.11 "ISFT" subchunk

This is mostly the same as in SoundFontÂ® 2.04, but UTF-8 is now used instead of ASCII.

- The "ISFT" subchunk contains a UTF-8 string of up to 256 bytes.
- Example of value: "SFe Editor version 4.00" (with appropriate zero bytes)

Reject anything not terminated with a zero byte. Do NOT reject the file as "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 5.12 "ISFe" subchunk

This would contain additional metadata for SFe specific features. Currently, in version 4.00, this is empty.

* * *

&nbsp;

# Section 6: "sdta-list" chunk

## 6.1a "smpl" sub-chunk

This sub-chunk should now be present in SFe64 files, as currently, there is no ROM where samples can be read from. This does not include AWE ROM emulation.

- This contains one or more samples of audio in linearly coded 16-bit, signed, little endian words.
- No more leeway of 46 zero-valued samples is required after each sample.
- Before saving, SFe64 editors should insert this leeway. Otherwise, they might give a warning telling the user that loop and interpolation quality may be affected.
- If ROM samples are detected in SFe files, attempt to load them, even if this sub-chunk is missing.
- If this sub-chunk is missing, and no ROM samples are found, show an error message as mentioned in the program specification.

* * *

## 6.1b About compression in SFe64

To implement compression in your SFe64 bank, please use [Werner SF3](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/SoundFont3Format) compression encoding.

- Werner SF3 is widely used by the open source community.
- It is a standard that is being developed right now.
- There is no final specification, but the Fluidsynth team have a draft specification for Werner SF3.
- The goal is to make sure that these specifications are usable together.
- All SFe64 players must implement Werner SF3.
- Not all SFe64 files are required to implement Werner SF3 right now, but in the future it will become a requirement.
- Werner SF3 supports multiple different compression formats.
- The "scom" sub-chunk found in specification versions 4.00.3 and earlier is now obsolete.
- Incompatible SF compression formats (.sfark, .sfpack, .sf2pack, .sfq) are prohibited. You should use Werner SF3.
- When Werner SF3 is in use, the size of smpl is not required to be a multiple of two, and the surrounding LIST chunk isn't padded to a multiple of two.

* * *

## 6.2a "sm24" and "sm32" sub-chunk

These sub-chunks are optional.

- The sm32 sub-chunk contains the least significant byte, and the sm24 sub-chunk contains the next least significant byte after sm32.
- Each sub-chunk is exactly half the size of the smpl sub-chunk for uncompressed SFe files. This may not apply when Werner SF3 is in use.
- For every two bytes in the smpl sub-chunk, there is one byte in these sub-chunks.
- Werner SF3 is limited to 16-bit samples. This limitation may be removed in future versions of SFe64.

![6.2a_1.png](../_resources/6.2a_1.png)

If these sub-chunks are present, they are combined with the other sub-chunks to create a sample with higher bitdepth.

- If the ifil version is below 2.04 (signifying an E-mu SystemsÂ® designed SoundFontÂ® standard before 2.04), both sm24 and sm32 are ignored.

- If the ifil version is exactly 2.04 (signifying the E-mu SystemsÂ® designed SoundFontÂ® 2.04 standard), only sm32 is ignored. The sm24 sub-chunk is still used.

- If these sub-chunks are not exactly half the size of the smpl sub-chunk (or otherwise invalid), the data should be ignored.

- If only the sm32 sub-chunk is invalid, the sm24 sub-chunk should still be loaded.

- However, if only the sm24 sub-chunk is invalid, both sub-chunks should be ignored.

- If the sm24 sub-chunk is ignored, the synthesizer should only attempt to render the first 16 bits of the samples contained within the smpl sub-chunk.

- If only the sm32 sub-chunk is ignored, the synthesizer should attempt to render both the smpl and sm24 sub-chunks, resulting in a 24-bit sample.

* * *

## 6.2b Using 8-bit samples

If the smpl sub-chunk is missing, but the sm24 or sm32 sub-chunks are present, 8-bit sample mode is to be activated.

- The sample depth is eight bits.
- The length of the sm24 sub-chunk should be rounded up to the nearest byte, as if the sub-chunk was being used with a smpl sub-chunk.
- If somehow, you've got both a sm24 and a sm32 sub-chunk, but no smpl sub-chunk, the sm24 sub-chunk is the most significant byte, and 16-bit sample playback is assumed.
- Editing software should give a warning if there is a sm24 and a sm32 sub-chunk but no smpl sub-chunk, and should convert it to a 2.01-compliant 16-bit format.
- This mode is only enabled if all samples are 8-bit. You cannot mix 8-bit and higher sample depths.
- SFe version 4 does not support non-standard sample bit depths (6-bit, 12-bit, 18-bit, etc.)

* * *

## 6.3 Looping rules

- No more leeway of eight samples is required.
- Before saving, SFe64 editors might give a warning about this leeway telling the user that loop and interpolation quality may be affected.

# Section 7: "pdta-list" chunk

## 7.1 "Hydra" structure

Like in E-mu SystemsÂ® SoundFontÂ® 2.04, the format SFe64 version 4.00 is based on, the structure used is known as the "hydra" structure.

According to E-mu SystemsÂ®, a hydra has nine heads. Cut one off, and another two grow.

No major changes have been made to the structure itself. All nine of the sub-chunks are required. If any are missing, the file is "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 7.2 "phdr" sub-chunk

The size of this chunk is a multiple of 38 bytes.

Its structure is the same as in SF2.04.

### wPreset Changes

- In SoundFontÂ® 2.04, bits 2â€“8 were used to select up to 128 instruments. Bits 1 and 9â€“16 were unused.
- Now, bits 10â€“16 can be used to select alternate banks.
- It's designed to be used with sysex or other commands corresponding to General MIDI extension resets.
- What bits 9â€“16 do in version 4:
    - Bit 9 remains reserved.
    - General MIDIâ„¢ one or two reset clears bits 10 and 11.
    - RolandÂ® GSÂ® reset clears bit 10 and sets bit 11.
    - YamahaÂ® XGÂ® reset sets bit 10 and clears bit 11.
    - RolandÂ® CM-64â„¢/CM-32Lâ„¢ reset sets bits 10 and 11.
    - Bit 12 is reserved for more MIDI commands in the future. For now, bit 12 should be written as clear.
    - Bits 13â€“16 will not be defined. The author of the SF may use these at will with their own MIDI commands.
    - MIDI sequencers will eventually be able to set or clear all bits from 10 to 16 using commands.
- It allows you to run multiple standards that may conflict with each other.

### wBank Changes

- Version 4.00.1 had a new field called wBank2.
- Now, wBank stores both m.s.b. and l.s.b. bank changes (CC00 and CC32), eliminating the need for wBank2.
- wBank is still a WORD. This change was possible as wBank is 16-bit, which is sufficient to store the 14-bit bank change space. We commend E-mu for being forward enough thinking to not use a CHAR/BYTE for bank selection.
- In SoundFontÂ® 2.04, and SFe version 4.00.1, bit 1 was only used with bank 128 (for percussion), and bits 2â€“8 were used to select a single bank between 0 and 127. Bits 9â€“16 were unused.
- wBank is little endian.
- Now, bit 9 is also a percussion toggle. If a bank/program change combination produces a different result for midi channel 10, bit 1 controls the percussion.
- File editors should warn the user if this issue is found.
- Bits 2â€“8 are now used to set the first bank change, and bits 10â€“16 are now used to set the second bank change.
- The default behavior is that bits 2â€“8 will set "m.s.b." (CC00) and bits 10â€“16 will set "l.s.b." (CC32), but version 4 compatible players should allow the user to swap CC00 and CC32 settings.
- Order in the phdr chunk in terms of wBank value.
- Summary:
    - Bit 1 = percussion toggle 1
    - Bit 2â€“8 = bank select m.s.b.
    - Bit 9 = percussion toggle 2
    - Bit 10-16 = bank selects l.s.b.

### Definitions of dwLibrary and dwGenre

Old 2.04 fields "dwLibrary" and "dwGenre" are now defined.

- "dwLibrary" is for the overall name of the set of files contained in a library of SFe, version 4 files.
    - For example, "SFe Collection!" (with appropriate zero bytes)
- "dwGenre" is for the genre of music which the files are optimized for.
    - For example, "Rock" (with appropriate zero bytes)
- "dwMorphology" has been left out of this draft specification. It will eventually be re-introduced in a future version.

### Do not access the final sfPresetHeader entry

The last sfPresetHeader entry shouldn't need to be accessed, apart from the uses described in the SF2.04 specification.

### This is a required sub-chunk

Files without a "phdr" sub-chunk are "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 7.3 "pbag" sub-chunk

This refers to the "Preset Bag" of the SFe file. This sub-chunk is a multiple of 4 bytes.

Its structure is the same as in SF2.04.

All values in this sub-chunk should be used as directed in the SF2.04 specification.

### This is a required sub-chunk

Files without a "pbag" sub-chunk are "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 7.4 "pmod" sub-chunk

The pmod sub-chunk is a multiple of 10 bytes.

The structure is very similar to SF2.04's PMod structure, with these differences:

### New options for the SFModulator enum

These options are listed elsewhere in the specification.

Legacy SF players which do not support these new enum options should ignore these new options.

This enum, and all other enums, is two bytes in length.

### This is a required sub-chunk

Files without a "pmod" sub-chunk are "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 7.5 "pgen" sub-chunk

The pgen sub-chunk is a multiple of four bytes, like in SF2.04.

The structure and type definitions are the same as in SF2.04:

### New options for the SFGenerator enum

These options are listed elsewhere in the specification.

Legacy SF players which do not support these new enum options should ignore these new options.

This enum is two bytes in length.

### This is a required sub-chunk

Files without a "pgen" sub-chunk are "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 7.6 "inst" sub-chunk

The inst sub-chunk is a multiple of 22 bytes.

### This is a required sub-chunk

Files without an "inst" sub-chunk are "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 7.7 "ibag" sub-chunk

This refers to the "Instrument Bag" of the SFe64 file.

This sub-chunk is a multiple of four bytes. This is like the pbag sub-chunk.

All values in this sub-chunk should be used as directed in the SF2.04 specification.

### This is a required sub-chunk

Files without an "ibag" sub-chunk are "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 7.8 "imod" sub-chunk

The imod sub-chunk is a multiple of 10 bytes, like the pmod sub-chunk.

The structure is very similar to SF2.04's imod structure, with these differences:

### New options for the SFModulator enum

These options are listed elsewhere in the specification.

Legacy SF players which do not support these new enum options should ignore these new options.

This enum, and all other enums, is two bytes in length.

### Preset and instrument modulators

The Preset Modulator values are added to the Instrument Modulator values, and that is the final modulator used.

### This is a required sub-chunk

Files without an imod sub-chunk are "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 7.9 "igen" sub-chunk

The igen sub-chunk is a multiple of four bytes, like the pgen sub-chunk.

### New options for the SFGenerator enum

These options are listed elsewhere in the specification.

Legacy SF players which do not support these new enum options should ignore these new options.

This enum is two bytes in length.

### This is a required sub-chunk

files without an "igen" sub-chunk are "Structurally Unsound."

* * *

## 7.10 "shdr" sub-chunk

The shdr sub-chunk contains the headers for the sample data.

It is a multiple of 46 bytes.

### Sample Rate Limit Changes

- In SFe, sample rates (dwSampleRate) are stored as a 32-bit integer. This is the same behavior as seen in the legacy SoundFontÂ® 2.04 format. This results in a theoretical maximum sample rate of 4,294,967,295 Hz.
- In the legacy SoundFontÂ® 2.04 specification, E-mu suggested that sample rates of below 400 Hz or above 50,000 Hz should be avoided as some legacy hardware platforms may not be able to reproduce these sounds. This is not a limitation of the specification, but rather a limitation of legacy sound cards.
- Despite this, Creative did not use 16-bit integers for sample rate in SF 2.04. It is thus safe to use sample rates in excess of 50,000 Hz. If a sample rate of below 400 Hz or above 50,000 Hz is encountered, no attempt should be made to change the sample rate.
- A zero sample rate should be reset.

### sfSampleType and Werner SF3

Bit 4 of "sfSampleType" is reserved for Werner SF3 usage.

- Read the draft Werner SF3 specification for information!
- This specification is available at:Â [SoundFont3Format Â· FluidSynth/fluidsynth Wiki (GitHub.com)](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/SoundFont3Format)
- Once the Werner SF3 specification is finalised, it will be included as part of the SFe specification documents.

The "sfSampleType" enum is two bytes in length.

### This is a required sub-chunk

Files without a "shdr" sub-chunk are "Structurally Unsound."

# Section 10: Error-handling

## 10.1 Structural errors

The error correction process for structural errors in SFe64 is slightly different from that in SFe32 or SF2.04:

- If a ds64 chunk, "BW64" or "RF64" header is found in a file, SFe32 players that do not support SFe64 should output a specific error, as mentioned in the SFe program specification.
- If the ds64 chunk is missing, it is an SFe32 file. Make sure that ckSize is accurate, using the same techniques as for SF 2.04.
    - If the value of ckSize is 4,294,967,295 (like in ds64), or any other inaccurate value, reject the file as "Structurally Unsound."
    - If the value of ckSize is correct, open the file and output a warning message, as mentioned in the SFe program specification.
    - More advanced programs may also recognize SFe64 files with 32-bit headers, and enable the SFe64 specific features. However, such a file should be repaired with a 64-bit header as soon as possible.
- SFe64 files with a ckSize value that is not 4,294,967,295 should be rejected as "Structurally Unsound," as this is not valid in RIFF64.

## 10.1a Duplicated preset locations within files

This occurs when the file is structurally damaged or manually edited in a manner where more than one preset has the same value of wBank and wPreset (for instance, 015:000:081).

- In SoundFontÂ® 2.04, the first preset in the location would be used by default, but the other presets would still be retained.
- Such other presets must be moved before they can be used.
- In SFe, the preset to be used is no longer necessarily the first one. Instead, selecting the correct preset (or combination of presets) to use will be permissible.
- Such a feature is optional, and if not implemented, the player should use the SF2.04 behavior in these cases (use the first preset found).
- Editors should warn the user if such presets are found.
- This behavior might change in future versions, so please take the "ifil" value, and later versions of this specification, into account. In particular, later versions of SFe will use the ISFe sub-chunk to determine this behavior.

* * *

## 10.1b Duplicated preset locations across files

This occurs when multiple files are loaded simultaneously (now a required feature for SFe), but some or all of the files have presets with identical wBank and wPreset values.

- Behavior was undefined in SoundFontÂ® 2.04.
- This was because multiple file loading was not a standard feature mandated in the legacy SoundFontÂ® standard.
- SF version 2 and 3 compatible software developers therefore had the liberty to implement multiple file loading; however, they wanted to.
- This edge case will now be defined in SFe.
- If multiple presets across loaded files have the same value of wBank and wPreset, then the preset to be used may be selectable from all the presets with the same bank location, depending on the player implementation. The preset to be used may also be a combination of multiple presets.
- Such a feature is also optional, and if not implemented, you can either use the first preset found, or you can combine all the presets.
- This behavior might change in future versions, so please note the "ifil" value, and later versions of this specification, into account. In particular, later versions of SFe will use the ISFe sub-chunk to determine this behavior.

* * *

## 10.2 Undefined chunks

SoundFontÂ® 2.04 players should ignore SFe-specific sub-chunks, as prescribed by E-mu.

Also, SFe version 4.00 compatible players, which do not support future versions, should ignore sub-chunks which are used in future versions.

* * *

## 10.3 Unknown Enumerators

Any ifil versions of 4.01 or above may have unknown enumeration values for a version 4.00 player.

This is entirely expected, and if unknown enumeration values are found, the Generator/Modulator should be ignored.

* * *

## 10.4 Illegal Parameter Values

Illegal parameter values are handled as in SoundFontÂ® 2.04.

* * *

## 10.5 Out of Range Values

Out of range values are handled as in SoundFontÂ® 2.04.

* * *

## 10.5a Exceeded Maximum File Size Limit

This occurs when the user loads a file that is larger than the maximum size that the SFe program can accommodate.

- In the AWE32 and AWE64, the limit was dependent on the memory installed on the card, which was up to 28 MiB.
- Later, the sound cards allowed the user to load files with file sizes up to system memory.
- SFe has defined limits that are found in the separate program specification.
- If these limits are reached, you can reject loading of the file with an error, or attempt to load the file anyway.
- SFe programs should warn the user if processing was automatically done to a file to reduce the file size to be in range.
- If multiple files are loaded, and the limit is reached, the order of files to be loaded can be defined by the author of the SFe64 compatible software.

* * *

## 10.6 Missing Required Items

If required items are missing, it is handled as in SoundFontÂ® 2.04.

* * *

## 10.7 Illegal Enumerators

Illegal enumerators are handled as in SoundFontÂ® 2.04.

# Section 11: SiliconSFe

Traditional SiliconSF banks are provided for compatibility purposes only, but we are unaware of any shipping products using SiliconSF.

Except for when size concerns prohibit its inclusion, SFe64 players should include an AWE ROM emulator.

- The AWE ROM emulator includes 152 samples.
- The file size should be 1MB, as all samples should be to the same standard as the original.
- Samples which the program developer has the right to use can be used as a replacement for the original ROM samples.
- Freely-usable reference implementation samples are available, but are not intended for production use.
- Sample names will remain the same, but there will be acceptable alias names.
- Emulators should also be able to open up SF files (either legacy SF or SFe) containing samples and metadata.
- There may or may not be instruments or presets.

The new system will also permit real time synthesis.

- Basic waveforms are provided.
- They should be generated in real time, not from samples.
- Wavetable synthesis can also be combined with different sounds.

Read the SoundFontÂ® 2.04 specification for information on how to make custom Silicon SF banks for older hardware.

A SiliconSFe specification will be available soon.

# Section 12: Glossary

This glossary is broadly the same as the SF2.04 specification's glossary, with these additions and changes:

- Amplification - An increase in volume or amplitude of a signal.

- Articulation - Modulation of available parameters and usage of extra samples to produce expressive musical notes.

- AWE64 - The successor to the famous AWE32, added things like waveguide synthesis. Use the EMU8000 synthesizer chip, like the preceding AWE32. Available in "Value" or "Gold" versions.

- BW64 - Broadcast Wave 64, used in the RF64 Header.

- DAHDSR - Stands for Delay, attack, hold, decay, sustain, release. The six-step envelope system used in SF and SFe.

- Downloadable - SF version 2, 3 or SFe file obtained from the internet. (Old meaning referred to the obsolete ROM system)

- EMU10K1 - The successor to the EMU8000, designed by E-muÂ® for the Creative Labs SB Live!.

- EMU10K2 - An update to the EMU10K1, designed by E-muÂ® for the Creative Labs SB Audigy.

- EMU20K1 - The successor to the EMU10K2, designed by E-muÂ® for the Creative Labs SB X-Fi.

- EMU20K2 - An update to the EMU20K1, please refer [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_X-Fi) for information on SB X-Fi cards that include it.

- Flat - Said of a tone that is lower in pitch than another reference tone.

- Hold - The portion of the DAHDSR envelope after the attack portion, but before the decay portion starts.

- MIDI Bank - Groups of up to 128 presets, which can be selected by the two MIDI "Bank Select" control changes (CC00 and CC32).

- RF64 - See "RIFF64".

- RIFF64 - A format mostly compatible with RIFF, SF2.04's basic file format. This is 64-bit, unlike RIFF, which is 32-bit. Therefore, the maximum file size is above four gigabytes in size.

- ROM samples - Obsolete feature used in legacy sound cards, most modern SF2 files do not use this feature.

- SoundblasterÂ® Live! - The successor to the AWE64, which improved the synthesizer chip to the EMU10K1, supporting modulators.

- SoundblasterÂ® Audigy - The successor to the SB Live!, containing the EMU10K2 chip.

- SoundblasterÂ® X-Fi - The successor to the SB Audigy, containing the EMU20K1 or EMU20K2 chip. Supports 24-Bit SoundFontÂ® 2 files (2.04).

- Synth - Abbreviation of "Synthesiser," see "Synthesiser" in the 2.04 specification for more information.

- Version 3 - Refers to Werner SF3, a small upgrade to SoundFontÂ® 2.04 created by Werner Schweer to allow an open source compression solution for SF programs (usually ogg, but can be any format).

- Version 4 - This new specification, based on SoundFontÂ® 2.04 and Werner SF3, with a set of new features making it more realistic. Not to be confused with the unofficial Cognitone .sf4 file format, which is a variant of Werner SF3.
