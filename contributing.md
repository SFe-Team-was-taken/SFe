# Contributing to SFe

If you have a proposal for how we could implement a new feature, then you can fork this repository and then create a pull request. Please fork from the "dev" branch, instead of the "main" branch.

If you've got an idea, but don't know how to implement it, then add an issue and describe what feature you want to see, and then we should respond to this proposal when we have time.
