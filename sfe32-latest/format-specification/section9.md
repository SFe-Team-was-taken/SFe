# Section 9: Parameters and synthesis model

## 9.1 SF version 4 synthesis model

In SFe32, the synthesis model will have massive improvements compared to the EMU8000-based synthesis model of Soundfont(r) 2.04 and Werner SF3 over time. Currently, it is identical to the synthesis model of Soundfont(r) 2.04, but version 4.01 will add the first improvements.

* * *

## 9.1.1 Sample based oscillator

The method of operation is identical to SoundFont(R) 2.04.

* * *

## 9.1.2 Sample looping

The method of operation is identical to SoundFont(R) 2.04, but different types of looping will be added in a future version of SFe32.

* * *

## 9.1.3 Filters

The method of operation is identical to SoundFont(R) 2.04, but different types of filters will be added in SFe32 version 4.01.

* * *

## 9.1.4 Final gain amplifier

The method of operation is identical to SoundFont(R) 2.04.

* * *

## 9.1.5 Effects Sends

The method of operation is identical to SoundFont(R) 2.04, but the chorus and reverb effects will be replaceable with different versions starting with SFe32 version 4.01.

* * *

## 9.1.6 Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs)

There are two LFOs which work in the same way as SoundFont(R) 2.04.

* * *

## 9.1.7 Envelope Generators

There are two envelope generators which work in the same way as SoundFont(R) 2.04.

* * *

## 9.1.8 Modulation interconnection

\[Insert figures of modulation interconnection\]

* * *

## 9.2 MIDI functions

Control Change #32 (Bank Select "LSB") has been modified to manipulate the high 8 bits of the wBank value.

All other MIDI functions are unchanged from SoundFont(R) 2.04.

If an SoundFont(R) 2.00a file is loaded, see the legacy SoundFont(R) 2.04 specification for more details for handling of SoundFont(R) 2.00 files.

* * *

## 9.3 Parameter units

All of these are the same as SoundFont(R) 2.04.

* * *

## 9.4 SF Generator Model

This is the same as SoundFont(R) 2.04.

* * *

## 9.5 SF Modulator Model

- Modulators work in the same way as SoundFont(R) 2.04, but an update will be made in SFe32 version 4.01.
- \[New diagrams available soon\]

* * *

## 9.6 NRPN implementation

The NRPN implementation used by version 4.00 is identical to SoundFont(R) 2.04.
