# Section 11: SiliconSFe

Traditional SiliconSF banks are provided for compatibility purposes only, but we are unaware of any shipping products using SiliconSF.

While it is optional, SFe32 players may include an AWE ROM emulator.

- The AWE ROM emulator includes 152 samples.
- The file size should be 1MB, as all samples should be to the same standard as the original.
- Samples which the program developer has the right to use can be used as a replacement for the original ROM samples.
- Freely-usable reference implementation samples are available, but are not intended for production use.
- Sample names will remain the same, but there will be acceptable alias names.
- Emulators should also be able to open up SF files (either legacy SF or SFe) containing samples and metadata.
- There may or may not be instruments or presets.

The new system will also permit real time synthesis.

- Basic waveforms are provided.
- They should be generated in real time, not from samples.
- Wavetable synthesis can also be combined for different sounds.

Read the SoundFont(R) 2.04 specification for information on how to make custom Silicon SF banks, for older hardware.

A SiliconSFe specification will be available soon.
