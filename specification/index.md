SoundFont® is a registered trademark of Creative Technology Ltd. The SoundFont® 2.04 file format is copyright © 1994–2002 E-mu Systems Inc.

To avoid confusion with the official SoundFont standard, the file format is referred throughout to as "SF" and/or "SFe". Future versions of SFe may not be compatible with legacy SF players.

That being said, "soundfont" is rapidly becoming a generalised word via the actions of the VGM (video game music) and lightsaber communities. If you are a member of the VGM, lightsaber, or another community, by not appropriating "SoundFont" for your unrelated formats, you can help keep the meaning of the trademark.

Any excerpts from SFSPEC24.PDF are copyrighted by Creative Technology Ltd, and are only used for reference. However, we are confident that the base file format is not copyrightable.
