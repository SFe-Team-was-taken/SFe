# Section 6: SFe enumerations and feature flags

## 6.1 About SFe enumerations

SFe 4.0 enumerations are identical to legacy SF2.04, but more enumerations may be defined in the future.

Once the enumeration model is changed significantly, we will list all changed modulator and generator enums with a clear explanation of what they do. Equations for timecents will also be included!

## 6.2 Feature flags

### 6.2.1 Feature flag tree structure

The feature flags system is split like this:

- Branches: Roughly corresponds to each version (but not all listed features are part of the version). Maximum of 256. Number may increase with later `wMajor` versions.
- Leaves: Corresponds to each feature. Maximum of 256. These may change with later `wMajor` versions. Contains 32-bit data declaring how much of the feature is implemented.
- Flags: Each of the 32 bits that comprise a leaf, declaring support for specific features.

Feature flags listed as "reserved" must not be used for private use. Branches 240 (`F0`) to 255 (`FF`) are provided for such use.
