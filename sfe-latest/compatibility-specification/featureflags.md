# SFe Feature Flags List 4.0.10

The feature flags system is split like this:

- Branches: Roughly corresponds to each version (but not all listed features are part of the version). Maximum of 256. Number may increase with later SFe64 wMajor versions.
- Leaves: Corresponds to each feature. Maximum of 256. These may change with later SFe64 wMajor versions. Contains 32-bit data declaring how much of the feature is implemented.
- Flags: Each of the 32-bits that comprise a leaf, declaring support for specific features.
