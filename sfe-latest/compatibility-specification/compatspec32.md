# SFe Compatibility Specification 4.0.11

This is a non-exhaustive list of compatibility workarounds relating to the legacy SF2.04 format and SFe 4.

### About compatibility specification versioning

If the version number of this specification is not yet updated, then the information here is up to date for the new specification.

### Legacy SF2.04 specification compatibility

If a legacy SF player is not fully compatible with legacy SF2.04, then SFe files might not work properly.

### INFO chunk and legacy compatibility

SFe files that use 32-bit chunk headers should be as compliant with the legacy standard as possible. `SFSPEC24.PDF` tells implementations to ignore additional sub-chunks in the `INFO-list` chunk, therefore it is possible to use the `INFO-list` chunk for additional data related to SFe.

If SFe files that use 32-bit chunk headers cannot be loaded on Sound Blaster cards, then something has went wrong.

### wMajor = 4 compatibility

Legacy SF programs may not support `wMajor=4`. You may need to use this defined workaround:

- If the file uses SFe Compression, use `wMajor=3`, `wMinor=1024`.
- Otherwise, use `wMajor=2`, `wMinor=1024`.

SFe 4 banks technically appear as Version `2.1024` or Version `3.1024` to legacy SF programs depending on if SFe Compression is used.

Legacy SF programs may not support `wMajor=3`, even if samples are uncompressed. It is safe to omit SFe Compression structures for uncompressed SFe banks.

### When to assume the isng sub-chunk as EMU8000

To maximise backwards compatibility with legacy SF banks, files with an ifil sub-chunk representing `2.04` or below should continue to assume an isng sub-chunk value of `EMU8000`.

Do NOT assume `EMU8000` when the ifil sub-chunk is >=`2.1024`.

### UTF-8 strings may be interpreted as ASCII

`SFSPEC24.PDF` officially defines all strings as ASCII strings. Because UTF-8 is mostly backwards compatible with ASCII, the strings found in SFe files are mostly compatible with legacy SF players. Mojibake may result on legacy systems when using characters unsupported by ASCII.

Some characters use multiple bytes in UTF-8. You may not be able to use as many multi-byte characters compared to single-byte characters.

### The `ISFe-list` chunk is not 100% legacy SF2.04 conformant

Officially, according to `SFSPEC24.PDF`, additional subchunks mean that an SFe file is not 100% conformant to the legacy SF2.04 standard.

However, said specification instructs implementations to ignore this sub-chunk if it is not recognised.

### Why are there no maximum length increases?

SFe 4 does not support increased maximum length changes due to backward compatibility concerns.

### Sample specifications

Players fully compliant with legacy SF2.04 should be able to play files with 32-bit samples at 24-bit quality. However, these files may fail on software (such as Polyphone 2.4.x) that looks specifically for `sm24` and reject anything else.

It is therefore not recommended to use 32-bit samples with legacy SF2.0x players. The `sm32` sub-chunk is implemented in the same way as `sm24` was by E-mu, to maximise compatibility.

Due to the massive size, unpracticality and compatibility implications of 32-bit samples, we recommend that you use the `sm32` sub-chunk only with a 64-bit or dynamic header.

The legacy specification ignores an `sm24` sub-chunk that is not paired with an `smpl` sub-chunk. Software that is compatible with legacy SF2.04, but is incompatible with SFe, will not play 8-bit samples, as legacy software cannot read the `ISFe-info` sub-chunk.

Legacy sound cards will also ignore lone `sm24` chunks.

Actual non-standard sample bit depths (6-bit, 12-bit, 18-bit, etc.) are not supported by SFe 4.

The recommended limits of the sample rate were 400-50000 in legacy SF2.04 due to quirks with legacy sound cards. ROM samples may still be used; therefore bit 16 should not be ignored.

### phdr sub-chunk

This sub-chunk must contain at least two entries. Failure to do so will affect the compatibility with legacy SF players.

wBank changes are not recognised by legacy SF players.Â On such legacy players, only the m.s.b. is retained.

Presets with l.s.b.=0 should be the first presets internally. You may also want to use VArranger's workaround: for example, `115@ConcertGrand`.

### Generators and modulators

In case of compatibility issues, the `shAmount` and `wAmount` options have been kept in for SFe 4. They may be removed in future versions of SFe.

If the SF version is below `2.1024`, and the isng value is equal to `EMU8000` or another E-mu sound engine:

- A 12dB low pass filter is used to ensure compatibility with the original AWE32 sound processor.
- Controller sources remain amplitude based.
- Ignore the whole modulator structure if a reserved source type is found.
- The Controller Source Type #16-#20 acts identically to the Controller Source Type #0-#4.

If the SF version is 2.04 or below, ignore the whole modulator structure if a reserved source type is found.

While default modulators 1-4 are not used in SFe version 4, SFe programs must still use them for older versions:

- If the SF version is 2.04, use the SF2.04 version of the Default Modulator 2.
- If the SF version is 2.01, use the SF2.01 version of the Default Modulator 2.
- If the sound engine is `EMU8000`, trigger legacy sound card mode.
- If the sound engine is `E-mu 10K1`, `E-mu 10K2`, `X-Fi`, or `SFe 4`, do not trigger legacy sound card mode.

Parameter units remain the same as SF2.04.

### Error handling

Legacy SF players may halt on undefined chunks. Section 10.2 of `SFSPEC21.PDF` and `SFSPEC24.PDF` forbid the addition of sub-chunks to the sdta-list chunk, but Creative/E-mu themselves decided to do it anyway when developing SF2.04 (by using the `sm24` sub-chunk).

Legacy SF players may halt on unknown enums, which goes against the legacy SF2.04 specification. However, Creative SoundFont Bank Manager does not error out on an unknown enum.

### Proprietary compression formats

If an incompatible proprietary compression format is found, then the program may offer decompression of the incompatible file before use if you have permission from the original author of the compression formats.

SF compression programs are notorious for restrictive licensing; the commercial license for these formats can no longer be purchased. These formats should not be used.
